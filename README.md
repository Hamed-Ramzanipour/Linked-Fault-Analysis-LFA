# Linked-Fault-Analysis-LFA
This repository contains the documentation of our simulations for the LFA. The novel cryptanalysis effectiveness and probability of success against a commonly used cryptographic algorithm are continually evaluated. In this case, we apply LFA to AES and PRESENT ciphers and illustrate the success probability of retrieving the secret values.
